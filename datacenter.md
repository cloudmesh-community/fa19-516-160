## E.Datacenter.2.b: Carbon footprint of data centers
* Data center   : Forest City
* Organization  : Facebook
* Location      : Forest City, NC
* Year Build    : 2012

Forest City is home to about 7,500 residents, as well as a major campus for Facebook. 
As a result, it has joined the ranks of rural towns that are populated by more servers than people. This is company's 
second  data center on its North Carolina campus.

   ### EQUINIX GREEN INITIATIVES
   Equinix was founded in 1998 with the goal to become a leader in data centers, they pioneer in green data centers
   They constantly work on their green technology. They always work on design power usage effectiveness (PUE).
   Following are few examples of site-specific solutions  incorporated by them:
   
   * Rooftop solar panels
   * Deep Lake Water Cooling (DLWC)
   * Green rooftops (plants and vegetation)
   * Water-side economizers
   And more.
    
    SG3 (Singapore), one of newest sites, runs on solar energy powers

* Largest Solar Farms ever Built for Google to Power Its Southeast Data Centers
Two solar projects in Tennessee and Alabama  will supply two data centers under construction with renewable energy (solar) most hours of the day.

* world’s largest data center is planned for Ballangen, a small Norwegian fjord town inside the Arctic Circle, adjacent to the Lofoten Islands.
Countries like Island are working towards using natural ways of colling data centers.

* China's Greenpeace:  Data Centers on Track to Use More Energy than All of Australia. Biggest data center under construction in  Guizhou Province of China.
There is lot of push to use renewable source of energy part of program.

### The ChilledDoor 
( A Whole New Cooling Experience )

The ChilledDoor® Rack Cooling System not only remove 100% of the heat from server rack, it is a way to change the dynamic of how data center is cooled.
It uses advanced technology “Active” rear door heat exchanger technology, by this cooling system becomes a dynamic entity, reacting to minute by minute changes in compute loads of up to 75kW. 
It can cool advanced High Performance Computers, high end storage, or simple switchgear, the ChilledDoor works to keep entire computing environment “heat neutral”.
Active rack cooling can redefine PUE and are ultra efficient, scalable and rack agnostic.

Pretty much what we do in our daily life has some impact on our planet. There are so many ways human adds to carbon footprint. 
Like wise large corporations adds to carbon footprint indirectly all that is driven by human (consumer) demand. When we look at the modern computing or data driven companies they seems to be very clean apparently these companies use large amount of energy.
Typically energy used by their data centers. Every time we click a link to search, upload a picture or watch a video we use energy starting form network, electronic device and data centers.
Article points to variety of ways we add to use of energy.
