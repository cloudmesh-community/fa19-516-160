# Cloudmesh Data Transfer service

Shreyans Jain

## Abstract

TBD
* Azure to Google cloud Cloudmesh Storage Provider for Virtual Directories: see cloudmesh-storage to start. develop OpenAPI REST services for it
* Py Test
  

## Objective

Provide cloudmesh users an API and REST service to transfer files, directories from data storage of one cloud service provider to other cloud service provider.  
This packge will consider  Azure Blob storage to Google cloud for current implementation.  


## Motivation

Cloud technology evolves at a very fast rate. Due to which, policies and facilities provided by cloud service providers change as well. There could be various practical scenarios in which users want to transfer the data currently stored in AWS S3 to Azure Blob. Such scenarios could be change in pricing policy or storage capacity rules of AWS S3 or Azure Blob.  

Cloudmesh is a multicloud platform. With inclusion of data transfer service, a highly optimized and simple to use methos will be made available to cloudmesh users.   

## Architecture
TBD

## Technology
* Python
* cloudmesh storage
* OpenAPI 3.0.2
* REST

## Usage  

* API:  
```
  Usage:
        transfer config [--file=ip_file]
        transfer --id=<transfer_id> --data=<file_name> [--copy=True|False]
        transfer status --id=<transfer_id>
        transfer statistic

  This command is part of CloudMesh's multicloud storage service. Command allows users to transfer
  files/directories from storage of one Cloud Service Provider (CSP) to storage of other CSP.
  Current implementation is to transfer data between Azure blob storage and AWS S3 bucket.

  Arguments:
      transfer_id   A unique id/name assigned by user to each transfer instance
      file_name     Name of the file/directory to be transferred
      Boolean       True/False argument for --copy option. When False, data will be removed from source location
      ip_file       Input file used to configure 'transfer' command

  Options:
      --id=transfer_id        Specify a unique i/name to the transfer instance
      --data=file_name        Specify the file/directory name to be transferred
      --copy=True|False       Specify is the data should be kept in source location after the transfer
      --file=ip_file          Specify the file to be used for configuration of the transfer instance
      -h                      Help function

  Description:
      transfer config [options..]
            Configures source/destination and authentication details to be used by transfer command

      transfer [options..]
            Transfers file/directory from storage of one CSP to storage of another CSP

      transfer status [options..]
            Returns status of given transfer instance

      transfer statistic
            Returns statistics of all transfer processes

  Examples:
      transfer --id="Dummy transfer" --data=dummy_file.txt --copy=True
```
